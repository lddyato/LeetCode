     * Intuition
     * To detect if a list is cyclic, we can check whether a node had been visited before. A natural way is to use a hash table.
     * Algorithm
     * We go through each node one by one and record each node's reference (or memory address) in a hash table. If the current node is null, we have reached the end of the list and it must not be cyclic.
     * If current nodeâ€™s reference is in the hash table, then return true.

     * Approach #2 (Two Pointers) [Accepted]
     * Intuition
     * Imagine two runners running on a track at different speed. What happens when the track is actually a circle?
     * Algorithm
     * The space complexity can be reduced to O(1) by considering two pointers at different speed - a slow pointer and a fast pointer.
     * The slow pointer moves one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
     * If there is no cycle in the list, the fast pointer will eventually reach the end and we can return false in this case.
     * Now consider a cyclic list and imagine the slow and fast pointers are two runners racing around a circle track.
     * The fast runner will eventually meet the slow runner. Why? Consider this case (we name it case A) - The fast runner is just one step behind the slow runner.
     * In the next iteration, they both increment one and two steps respectively and meet each other.
     * How about other cases? For example, we have not considered cases where the fast runner is two or three steps behind the slow runner yet.
     * This is simple, because in the next or next's next iteration, this case will be reduced to case A mentioned above.
