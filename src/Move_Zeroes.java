/**
 * Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
 * For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].
 * Note:
 * You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
 * Minimize the total number of operations.

     * This question comes under a broad category of "Array Transformation". This category is the meat of tech interviews. Mostly because arrays are such a simple and easy to use data structure. Traversal or representation doesn't require any boilerplate code and most of your code will look like the Pseudocode itself.
     * The 2 requirements of the question are:
     * Move all the 0's to the end of array.
     * All the non-zero elements must retain their original order.
     * It's good to realize here that both the requirements are mutually exclusive, i.e., you can solve the individual sub-problems and then combine them for the final solution.
